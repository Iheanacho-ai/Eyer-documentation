This article explores observability, the superpower to see through your complex processes and systems. 
<!-- truncate -->

It discusses how tools like [Eyer](https://www.eyer.ai/) and their integration with [Boomi](https://boomi.com/) can empower you to monitor and understand your data flows, pinpoint anomalies, and ensure smooth operation across your hybrid IT landscape.


Driven by ever-evolving user expectations and a desire to empower communities through software, modern systems have undergone an explosion of complexity in recent decades. The rise of microservices has replaced clunky, monolithic giants with agile, modular structures. This shift offers flexibility and scalability but creates a tangled web of interconnected systems.

Without proper orchestration tools, each microservice operates independently, leading to data siloing. Valuable information gets locked away, hindering insights and optimization of the entire ecosystem.

Troubleshooting within this fragmented landscape becomes a frustrating maze. Siloed data and disparate metrics lengthen resolution times, impacting user experience and service reliability. 

But what if you could escape this maze? What if you could gain unparalleled visibility into this intricate web of systems? Cue observability.


## What is Observability?

Borrowed from control theory, "[observability](https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability#:~:text=the%20next%20step-,What%20is%20observability%3F,knowledge%20of%20its%20external%20outputs.)" refers to the ability to infer a system's internal state solely from its external outputs. Its goal? To minimize the time it takes to identify and resolve problems within an ecosystem, thereby enhancing agility and resilience.

This concept is fundamental in heterogeneous distributed systems, where something is bound to go wrong. By implementing robust observability practices, developers and operations teams gain invaluable insights into the inner workings of their systems. This empowers them to proactively detect and address issues before they snowball into major problems, ultimately enhancing user experience and minimizing operational costs.

The magic of observability lies in its ability to pinpoint what's wrong and provide rich context around those errors. This is achieved through key performance telemetry data, which includes:

- **Logs:** Logs are timestamped textual records of application events that developers can reference for troubleshooting and debugging processes.
- **Metrics:** Metrics are numerical gauges of an application or system's health over time. Examples include CPU utilization, memory usage, transaction volume, and latency. These metrics offer a bird's-eye view of the system's well-being and are readily aggregated and visualized for easy interpretation.
- **Traces:** In a distributed system, traces chart the journey of a user request as it navigates through various services. This detailed map sheds light on user issues by clearly identifying the point of failure within the request's journey.

**Observability vs Monitoring**
With the recent buzz surrounding observability, a natural question arises: is this simply a trendy rebrand of existing concepts like [monitoring](https://circleci.com/blog/observability-vs-monitoring/)? While both aim to understand system health and performance, their approaches differ significantly.

Monitoring, while valuable, often struggles to provide context for system failures. It relies on predefined metrics, alerting only when thresholds are breached. Observability extends beyond predefined metrics, capturing a wider range of data – logs, traces, and more – to paint a complete picture of the system's internal state.

With observability, you can figure out what went wrong, when (metrics and logs), and how it went wrong via traces. So, while monitoring might tell you there is a fire, observability will tell you where it started, how it spread, and what might be fueling it.


## Observability with Eyer and Boomi

While this article has explored the concept of observability and its importance in modern software development, it is worth mentioning that observability is not easy to implement without the right tools.

Fortunately, [Eyer](https://www.eyer.ai/) and Boomi offer a powerful solution to this challenge. To grasp the transformative power of their integration, let's delve into the capabilities of Boomi as an iPaaS solution.

**What is Boomi?**
[Boomi](https://boomi.com/) is an [Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas#:~:text=Integration%20Platform%20as%20a%20Service%20(iPaaS)%20is%20a%20suite%20of,individual%20or%20across%20multiple%20organizations.)) that connects data, applications, and people across your B2B ecosystem effortlessly. It eliminates data silos by automatically transferring information between systems, saving you from manual headaches. Whether integrating your CRM with your marketing platform or syncing inventory levels with your e-commerce store, Boomi ensures seamless data flow across your entire business network, unlocking the full potential of your data and applications.

With Boomi ensuring seamless data flow across your ecosystem, the next challenge is gaining true visibility into how all these interconnected pieces operate. That's where Eyer, a powerful observability platform, comes in.
