# Introduction
AI Monitoring for Boomi: Enhancing Performance and Efficiency.

Experience a new level of efficiency and performance with AI monitoring for Boomi. Designed specifically for IT professionals, system administrators, business owners, and data analysts, this powerful tool revolutionizes the way you monitor and manage your Boomi integrations. 

Eyer possess extensive knowledge about the integration market, solutions and use cases, and this has been leveraged to build a complete anomaly detection package for the Boomi runtime (Atoms & Molecules)

## Why Eyer & Boomi 
The Eyer platform is an automated time-series observability platform that easily integrates and supports different technologies through APIs.

Eyer will integrate directly in Boomi processes, giving the user the power to act on early warnings relating to Atom & Molecule performance like throughput, latency and other metrics related to runtime processing. Some use cases are listed in chapter 3, with examples of data to act on from the anomaly alerts and how to utilise the data in a Boomi process.
