# Eyer Boomi connector & recipes

The Eyer Boomi connector allows the user to interface the anomaly & correlation engine, within a Boomi process. 

Time-series data from the Atoms & Molecules described in chapter 3 will be used to detect anomalies and correlations. The anomaly alerts with detailed information can then be used in Boomi processes to automatically take action and for decision making. Some use cases based on anomaly detection are listed below in section 5.

Eyer will provide Boomi recipes to get users quickly up and running.
