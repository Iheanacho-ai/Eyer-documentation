# Eyer Use cases

:::warning

This documentation is constantly being improved. If you find any issues, please send us an [email](mailto:amarachi2812@gmail.com)

The "Getting Started with the Eyer Connector" section explains that while you can opt to receive alerts for every anomaly and its changes, this can quickly become overwhelming and lead to alert fatigue.

However, with the Boomi Business Rules Shape, you can filter these alerts, ensuring you only receive those relevant to you. Whether it's new, updated, or closed anomalies, you can tailor the alerts to your preferences. Furthermore, you can specify nodes, systems, and metrics for which you want to receive anomaly alerts and even choose how to respond to these alerts, either manually or automatically.

This section documentation will guide you through defining these rules to efficiently manage and respond to the anomalies most matter to you.
