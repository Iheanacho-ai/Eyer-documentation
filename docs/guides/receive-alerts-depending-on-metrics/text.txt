The "Getting Started with the Eyer Connector" section explains that while you can opt to receive alerts for every anomaly and its changes, this can quickly become overwhelming and lead to alert fatigue.

However, with the Boomi Business Rules Shape, you can filter these alerts, ensuring you only receive those relevant to you. Whether it's new, updated, or closed anomalies, you can tailor the alerts to your preferences. Furthermore, you can specify nodes, systems, and metrics for which you want to receive anomaly alerts and even choose how to respond to these alerts, either manually or automatically.

This documentation will guide you through defining these rules to efficiently manage and respond to the anomalies most matter to you.


## Adding the Business rules shape to your process

The Business Rules Shape allows us to define rules in the Boomi connector. 

Create a new Boomi process using the Eyer-Partner connector and configure it with the **Dynamic Operation properties**. For detailed instructions on setting up the connector, refer to the [Configuring the Eyer Connector](https://eyer-docs.netlify.app/docs/getting-started-with-eyer/configuring-the-eyer-connector) documentation.

Your Eyer-Partner connector setup should look like this:

Next, add a Business Rules shape to this process. Click on the Business Rules shape to open the **Business Rules Shape Options** modal. In this model, select a JSON profile type. Select the profile you created in the Profile input field when configuring the Eyer-Partner connector.

Next, click the **OK** button to open the **Business Rules Shape** modal. In this modal, click the **Create a New Rule** button to create a new business rule.

These rules will define the kind of anomaly alerts you receive or the anomalies you wish to take action on. The use cases will provide detailed instructions on creating these various rules.


## Getting a list of anomaly alerts depending on the severity of anomalies

This section discusses how to filter anomalies based on their status and severity.

It is important to note that each of these use cases follows directly from the** Adding the Business rules shape** to your process section. 

**Use case 1: Receive an alert on new anomalies with a severity equal to or greater than medium**

Add a business rule to create an alert only when the anomalies are new and have a medium or severe level of severity.

After clicking the **Create a New** Rule button, click the **Add** dropdown.

In the **Add** dropdown, select Field from the menu. 



**add an image**


This action will open an **Add a field **modal. Give the Alias field the name of “NewAnomalies”.

Next, click on the Field input area to open a New Input modal within this modal. Select this menu: **Object -> new -> Array -> items1 -> Object -> severity**.



**add an image**


Click the **OK -> OK** button to save your collection.

Next, click the **OR** button to signify that the test passes if either one of these conditions are true. 



**add an image**


Next, create a condition that checks the anomalies' severity by following these processes:



* Click the **Add a Condition** link:
* In the first dropdown, select the **NewAnomalies** field
* In the second dropdown, select the **=** field
* In the third dropdown, select the **Static** field
* In the fourth field, input “medium”
* Click the **Save** button



**add an image**


With this process, you've created a condition to check if the new anomalies have medium severity. Repeat this process to check for new anomalies with a severity level of "severe", but replace the fourth field with the string "severe," as shown below:

**add an image**


Click the **OK** button to save the Business rules.

**Use case 2:** ** Receive an alert on updated anomalies with severities equal to or greater than medium**

To create an alert only when the anomalies are updated and have a severity level of either medium or severe, add a business rule.

After clicking the Create a New Rule button, click the **Add** dropdown, 

In the **Add** dropdown, select **Field** from the menu. This action will open an **Add a field** modal. Give the **Alias** field the name of “UpdatedAnomalies”.

Next, click on the **Field** input area to open a **New Input** modal within this modal. Select this menu: **Object -> updated -> Array -> items1 -> Object -> severity**.



**add an image**


Click the **OK -> OK** button to save your collection.

Next, click the **OR** button to signify that you want to signify that the test passes if either one of these conditions is true. 

Next, create a condition that checks the anomalies' severity level  by following these processes:



* Click the **Add a Condition** link:
* In the first dropdown, select the **UpdatedAnomalies** field
* In the second dropdown, select the **=** field
* In the third dropdown, select the **Static** field
* In the fourth field, write “medium”
* Click the **Save** button



**add an image**


With this process, you've created a condition to check if the updated anomalies have medium severity. 

Repeat this process to check for updated anomalies with a severity level of "severe", replacing  the fourth field with the string "severe" as shown below:



**add an image**




**add an image**


Click the **OK** button to save the Business rules.

**Use case 3:** ** Receive an alert on closed anomalies and used to have severities equal to, or greater than medium**

Add a business rule to create an alert only when closed anomalies have a severity level of medium or severe.

After clicking the Create a New Rule button, click the Add dropdown, 

In the **Add** dropdown, select **Field** from the menu. This action will open an **Add a field** modal. Give the **Alias** field a value of “ClosedAnomalies”.

Next, click on the **Field** input area to open a New Input modal within this modal. Select this menu: **Object -> closed -> Array -> items1 -> Object -> severity**.



**add an image**


Click the **OK -> OK** button to save your collection.

Then, click the **OR** button to signify that you want to signify that the test passes if either one of these conditions is true. 

Next, create a condition that checks the anomalies’ severity by following these processes:



* Click the **Add a Condition** link:
* In the first dropdown, select the ClosedAnomalies field
* In the second dropdown, select the = field
* In the third dropdown, select the Static field
* In the fourth field, write “medium”
* Click the save button



**add an image**


With this process, you've created a condition to check if the closed anomalies have medium severity. Repeat this process to check for closed anomalies with a severity level of "severe", replacing  the fourth field with the string "severe" as shown below:

**Use Case 4: As a user, I want to receive an alert & log IF a new anomaly alert contains a specific node and system with alert criticality >= z**

Add business rules to filter anomalies and create an alert only when the new anomalies contain anomalies on a specific system or node. To understand what nodes are and the different examples of nodes available for reference, check out the [Eyer documentation](https://customer.support.eyer.ai/servicedesk/customer/article/47153153).

After clicking the **Create a New** Rule button, select the **Add** dropdown.

In the **Add** dropdown, select **Field** from the menu. 



**add an image**


This action will open an **Add a field** modal. In this modal, input an Alias of “NewAnomaliesSystem”.

Next, click the Field input area to open the **New Input** modal menu. Navigate through the menu by selecting **Object -> new -> Array -> items1 -> Object -> items ->  Array ->  items1 -> Object -> node -> Object -> system -> Object -> name**.



**add an image**


Click the** OK -> OK **button to save the field.

Next, create another field to capture the specific node where the anomaly occurred. Similar to creating the **NewAnomaliesSystem** field, select the **Field** menu from the **Add **dropdown. 

This action opens up an **Add a field** modal; in this modal, input “NewAnomaliesNode” in the **Alias** field.

Then, click the **Field** input area to open a **New Input** modal menu. within this modal. Navigate through the menu by selecting **Object -> new -> Array -> items1 -> Object -> items ->  Array ->  items1 -> Object -> node -> Object -> name**.



**add an image**


Click the **OK -> OK** button to save the **NewAnomaliesNode** field.

Next, create the last field to capture the severity of the anomalies. As you’ve done for the last two fields, select the **Field** menu from the **Add** dropdown. 

This action opens up an **Add a field** modal; in this modal, input “NewAnomaliesSeverity” in the **Alias** field.

Then, click the **Field** input area to open the **New Input** modal menu. within this modal. Navigate through the menu by selecting **Object -> new-> Array -> items1 -> Object -> severity**.



**add an image**


Click the **OK -> OK** button to save the options.

Once you've created the fields, you need to define the conditions that will trigger an alert. These conditions will check if the values in the fields match your criteria for receiving alerts.

Here are the three conditions you would define for this use case:



* The first condition verifies if the **NewAnomaliesSystem** field matches the specific system you're interested in monitoring
* The second condition ensures the nodes involved in the anomaly alerts are the ones you care about. You'll use the **NewAnomaliesNode** field to check this.
* The third condition confirms if the anomaly's severity level meets your threshold.

To create a new condition, perform the following processes:



* Click the **Add a Condition** link:
* In the first dropdown, select the **NewAnomaliesSystem** field
* In the second dropdown, select the **=** field
* In the third dropdown, select the **Static** field
* In the fourth field, input the name of the System you care that the anomalies come from
* Click the **Save** button



**add an image**


Click the **AND** operator, then repeat the create a new condition process for the **NewAnomaliesNodes** field. The differences to make are:



* In the first dropdown, input  NewAnomaliesNodes
* In the fourth field, input the name of the node you are looking for

Click the **AND** operator, and repeat the create a condition process for the **NewAnomaliesSeverity** field. The differences to make are: 



* In the first dropdown, input  **NewAnomaliesSeverity**
* In the second dropdown, choose the **!=** operator
* Leave the fourth field empty.

This ensures that the severity field of the anomaly alerts is not empty.

Click the OK button to save the Business rules. Here is what your Business Rules shape should look like.

## Getting the Alerts

The [Boomi ecosystem offers many connectors](https://help.boomi.com/docs/atomsphere/integration/connectors/c-atm-connectors_bb305b35-0f13-4937-a918-f85dbbe1b27b/) that you can use to receive information on anomalies, with the most popular way of receiving these alerts being the Mail connector.  Check out the [Boomi documentation](https://help.boomi.com/docs/atomsphere/integration/connectors/r-atm-mail_connector_4e32e771-5351-4e2c-b1fd-d7bd1bd82f1a/#:~:text=Use%20the%20Mail%20connector%20to,exchanging%20data%20between%20trading%20partners.) to learn how to connect and configure your Mail connector.
