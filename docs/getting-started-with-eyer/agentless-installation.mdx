# Agentless - Install option 2 

> **_NOTE:_** This is installation setup is for larger scale production applications. It is used if you do not want to install any other components on the host running the Atoms. All components for collecting metrics and transmitting data to Eyer can be deployed to a seperate host.

The Eyer for Boomi connector setup requires you to download these three components:

* [Jetty (version 12 or higher)](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/download.php)
* [Influx Telegraf open source data collector](https://www.influxdata.com/downloads/)
* [Jolokia (war unsecured agent, version 2.02 or higher)](https://jolokia.org/download.html)
x

## Exposing JMX ports on your Atom

Log in to your [Boomi AtomSphere account](https://platform.boomi.com/) and select your Atom. Navigate to the **Properties -> Advanced** tab to add and expose the following JMX ports on your Atom:



* JMX Remote Port ( 5002 )
* JMX Remote RMI Port ( 5002 )
* JMX Remote SSL ( disabled )
* JMX Remote Authentication ( disabled )

Each of your Atoms should look like this when you are done.

Restart your Atom to see the changes.


## Deploying Jolokia in a Jetty server

After you've set up and configured your Boomi Atom, the next step is to create and deploy the Jetty server that will hold your Jolokia agent. To do that follow these steps:

1. Set up a `JETTY_HOME` variable in your terminal by running this command: replace `<path to your jetty-home folder>` with the actual path to your downloaded and unzipped Jetty home folder.

  ```
  $JETTY_HOME= <path to your jetty-home folder>
  ```

2. Create and change your present directory into a jetty-base folder with this terminal command.
  ```
  mkdir jetty-base
  cd jetty-base
  ```


3. Next, run this command to create the `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/` directory and other configuration directories for the Jetty server.
  ```
  java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=server,http,ee10-deploy
  ```


4. Deploy the Jetty's demo web applications with this command.
  ```
  java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=demos
  ```


5. Next, open the jetty-base folder you created in step two. Inside this folder, there is a webapps folder. Copy your downloaded Jolokia agent file into the webapps folder.


6. Start your Jetty server with this command: 
  ```
  java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar 

  ```


7. To verify if your Jetty server is running with your Jolokia, go to http://localhost:8080/jolokia/.



## Installing Telegraf 

Telegraf is an open-source agent that collects metrics from your applications. To run your Telegraf as a service, you need to download the [eyer_agentless_telegraf.conf](https://customer.support.eyer.ai/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/30015491) file.

Next, rename the provided `eyer_agentless_telegraf.conf` file to `telegraf.conf`. 

In the newly downloaded Influx Telegraf folder, replace the existing telegraf.conf file with the renamed one. Then, make the following edits to the `telegraf.conf` file.

1. **Enable authentication using your Eyer agent API token**: Locate the `[outputs.http.headers]` section, in this section, replace the authenticate field's value with your Eyer agent API token

  ```
  # ## Additional HTTP headers
    [outputs.http.headers]
  #   #   # Should be set manually to "application/json" for json data_format
  #   #   Content-Type = "text/plain; charset=utf-8"
      authenticate = "you authentication token goes here"

  ```
2. **Configure Jolokia connection**: In the `# # Read JMX metrics from a Jolokia REST agent endpoint` section, make the following changes:

    * Duplicate the `[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy]]` section, along with all metrics, for each Atom you wish to monitor. If you're monitoring only one Atom, skip this step.

    * Edit each of the URLs to reflect your Jolokia IP address. Replace the `x.x.x.x` path in the URL with your `jolokia` IP address.

      ```
      # # Read JMX metrics from a Jolokia REST agent endpoint
      [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy]]
        url = "http://x.x.x.x:8080/jolokia"
      ```


    * Next, edit each of the urls in the `[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]` section to reflect the IPs where your atoms are hosted. Replace the `x.x.x.x` path in the URL with your Boomi Atom’s IP address.  

      ```
      [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]
        url = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://x.x.x.x:5002/jmxrmi"
      ```



    If you only monitor a single atom, and your Telegraf agent is hosted in the same location as the Jolokia agent, use this url:


    ```
     [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]
      url = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:5002/jmxrmi"
    ```


3. Save the changes made to the `telegraf.conf` file.

4. Once you’ve made your changes to the `telegraf.conf` file, change your current directory to the Telegraf folder containing the `telegraf.exe`, and the `telegraf.conf` files.

    Then register and start your Telegraf agent as a service with the following commands for your operating system.  

    * For Windows users, start your Telegraf agent with this command.

        ```
        .\telegraf.exe --service install --config telegraf.conf
        .\telegraf.exe --service start
        ```


    * For Linux users, start your Telegraf agent with this command:

      ```
      sudo systemctl start telegraf
      ```
