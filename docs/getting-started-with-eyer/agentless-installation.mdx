# Agentless - Install option 1 

The Eyer for Boomi connector setup requires you to download these three components:



* [Jetty (version 12 or higher)](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/download.php)
* [Influx Telegraf open source data collector](https://www.influxdata.com/downloads/)
* [Jolokia (war unsecured agent, version 2.02 or higher)](https://jolokia.org/download.html)


## Exposing JMX ports on your Atom

Log in to your [Boomi AtomSphere account](https://platform.boomi.com/) and select your Atom. Navigate to the **Properties -> Advanced** tab to add and expose the following JMX ports on your Atom:



* JMX Remote Port ( 5002 )
* JMX Remote RMI Port ( 5002 )
* JMX Remote SSL ( disabled )
* JMX Remote Authentication ( disabled )

Each of your Atoms should look like this when you are done.

Restart your Atom to see the changes.


## Deploying Jolokia in a Jetty server

After you've set up and configured your Boomi Atom, the next step is to create and deploy the Jetty server that will hold your Jolokia agent. To do that follow these steps:
1. Create a JETTY_HOME variable in your terminal. To create this variable, run this command, replace the `<path to your jetty-home folder>` placeholder with the actual path to your downloaded and unzipped jetty-home folder.

```
$JETTY_HOME= <path to your jetty-home folder>
```

2. Create and change present directory into a jetty-base folder with this terminal command.
```
mkdir jetty-base
cd jetty-base
```

3. Create a `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/` directory and other directories that contain the configuration of the server with this command:
```
java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=server,http,ee10-deploy
```

4. Deploy Jetty's demo web applications with this command:
```
java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=demos
```

5. Next, open the jetty-base folder you created in step two. In this folder, you will see the webapps folder, copy your downloaded jolokia agent into this webapps folder.


6. Start your Jetty server with this command: 
```
java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar 

```

7. To verify if your Jetty server is running with your Jolokia, go to http://localhost:8080/jolokia/, and you should see this:



## Installing Telegraf 

Telegraf is an open-source agent that collects metrics from your applications. Download and install the Telegraf agent that corresponds with your OS from the [InfluxData Downloads page](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/).

Next, rename the provided `eyer_agentless_telegraf.conf` file and to `telegraf.conf`. This file will replace the original `telegraf.conf` file in your newly downloaded Influx Telegraf folder. Afterward, make the following edits to the configuration file:



1. Enable authentication using your Eyer agent API token: Locate the `[outputs.http.headers]` section, in this section, replace the authenticate field's value with your Eyer agent API token
2. Configure Jolokia connection: In the `# # Read JMX metrics from a Jolokia REST agent endpoint` section, make the following changes:

    * Duplicate the `[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy]]` section, along with all metrics, for each Atom you wish to monitor. If you're monitoring only one Atom, skip this step.

    * Edit each of the URLs to reflect your Jolokia IP address. Replace the `x.x.x.x` path in the URL with your `jolokia` IP address.

      ```
      # # Read JMX metrics from a Jolokia REST agent endpoint
      [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy]]
        url = "http://x.x.x.x:8080/jolokia"
      ```


    * Next, edit each of the urls in the `[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]` section to reflect the IPs where your atoms are hosted. Replace the `x.x.x.x` path in the URL with your Boomi Atom’s IP address.  

      ```
      [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]
        url = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://x.x.x.x:5002/jmxrmi"
      ```



    If you only monitor a single atom, and if your Telegraf agent is hosted in the same location as the Jolokia agent, use this url:


    ```
     [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]
      url = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:5002/jmxrmi"
    ```


3. Save the changes made to the `telegraf.conf` file.

4. When you are done with your edits, register and start the Telegraf agent, depending on your operating system.  

    * For Windows users, start your Telegraf agent with this command.

        ```
        telegraf.exe –config telegraf.conf
        ```


    * For Linux users, start your Telegraf agent with this command:

      ```
      sudo systemctl start telegraf
      ```
    * For MacOS users, start your Telegraf with this command.

      ```
      telegraf --config telegraf.conf
      ```
