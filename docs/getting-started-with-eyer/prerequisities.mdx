# Prerequisites

The following are required to install the Eyer Partner Connector agents:
- The machine learning algorithms rely on a continuous stream of data to learn effectively. So for trial deployments of the agent(s), make sure you choose an environment that closely mimics production. This means an environment with 24/7 uptime, like a QA or testing environment, where both the agents and atoms are constantly running. 

- You must have admin rights on the host you intend to deploy your agent(s).

- The agent setup requires data from the following sources:

    - [Jetty](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/download.php): Jetty provides a web server and servlet container, supporting features like HTTP/2, WebSocket, and more. It's open-source and free for commercial use.
    - [Influx Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/downloads/): Telegraf is a popular open-source agent for collecting metrics from various sources. 
    - [Jolokia](https://jolokia.org/download.html): Jolokia acts as a JMX-HTTP bridge, offering an alternative to JSR-160 connectors.
    
    **Note:**
    If directly downloading on the agent host isn't possible, download the files beforehand and transfer them for deployment.

- The agentless installation does not require you to set up the Telegraf and Jolokia agents on the hosts running the atoms. However, you must deploy these agents on a host that has network access to the hosts running the Atoms.

- The agent(s) will transmit data to https://data.eyer.ai/api/telegraf over https. Make sure your firewall allows these connections.


> **_NOTE:_** For early adopters, the anomaly detection will be automatically enabled 7 days after you start sending data. You will receive an email that confirming the enablement. 
> 
> The agents must be connected and running at all times for this period to provide sufficient training data for the machine learning. The Eyer - TPP connector for Boomi will not return any anomaly alerts for the training period.
