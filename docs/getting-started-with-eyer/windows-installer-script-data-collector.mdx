# Data collector install - Windows installer script version

> All components for collecting metrics from the Atoms and transmitting data to Eyer can be deployed to a separate host (for test-setups, all components can be deployed to the Atom host).

The Eyer connector needs to collect and learn from your atom's data to identify normal and abnormal behaviors. To get started, follow this installation guide:

1. Log in to your[ Boomi AtomSphere account](https://platform.boomi.com/) and select your Atom. Navigate to the **Properties -> Advanced** tab to add and expose the following JMX ports on your Atom:
    * JMX Remote Port -> Property Value of 5002
    * JMX Remote RMI Port -> Property Value of 5002
    * JMX Remote SSL -> Disable this property by leaving its property value checkbox unchecked
    * JMX Remote Authentication -> Disable this property by leaving its property value checkbox unchecked
2. Save the changes and restart your atom.
3. Open your PowerShell terminal as an Administrator.
4. Run this command to download Telegraf, Jetty, and Jolokia. After downloading, the command will deploy Jolokia on the Jetty server.

```
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eyer-development/public-boomi-scripts/master/win-agentless-installer.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eyer-development/public-boomi-scripts/master/win-agentless-installer.ps1)'))
```



5. The command above opens up the Telegraf folder in your file explorer, usually located in `%AppData%\Roaming\eyer\telegraf directory`.
6. In your Telegraf folder, open up the `telegraf.conf` file and make the following edits:
* Locate the `[outputs.http.headers]` section. Replace the authenticate field's value with your Eyer agent API token in this section.

```
[outputs.http.headers]
	authenticate = "your_api_key"
```



* Duplicate the `[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy]]` section and all metrics for each Atom you wish to monitor. If you're monitoring only one Atom, do not duplicate.
* Edit each of the URLs to reflect your Jolokia IP address. Replace the `x.x.x.x` path in the URL with your Jolokia IP address. 

``` 
 # # Read JMX metrics from a Jolokia REST agent endpoint
    [[inputs.jolokia2_proxy]]
        url = "http://x.x.x.x:8080/jolokia"
``` 



* Next, edit the URLs in the `[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]` section to reflect the IPs where your atoms are hosted. Replace the `x.x.x.x` path with your Boomi Atom's IP address in the URL.  

```
[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]
    url = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://x.x.x.x:5002/jmxrmi"
```

If you only monitor a single atom, and your Telegraf agent is hosted in the same location as the Jolokia agent, use this URL:

```
[[inputs.jolokia2_proxy.target]]
    url = "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:5002/jmxrmi"
```



7. Save the changes made to the telegraf.conf file.
8. Next, use this command to change your current directory into the Telegraf directory containing the `telegraf.conf` and `telegraf.exe` files.

```
cd "C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf"
```



9. Next, install the Telegraf agent as a service in your Powershell terminal.   

```
.\telegraf.exe --service install `
--config "C:\Program Files\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf.conf"                   
```



10. Run this command to test your Telegraf installation. If successful, you'll see your Atom metrics.

```
.\telegraf.exe `
--config C:\"Program Files"\InfluxData\telegraf\telegraf.conf --test
```



11. Start Telegraf as a service using this command:

```
.\telegraf.exe --service start
```



12. Check if your Telegraf service is running using this command:

```
Get-service Telegraf
```
