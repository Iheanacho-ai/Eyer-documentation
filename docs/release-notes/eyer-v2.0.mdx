# Eyer v2.0 release notes

* Consolidated all operations into a single operation, controlled with parameters

* Multi-tenancy support. 

    * This means that you now can run multiple instances of alert query (for instance have multiple Boomi processes querying for alerts). Do enable this, you need a unique key per instance.

 

v2.0 will be a breaking change, meaning that if you have v1.0 installed, you will need to re-do your Eyer connector setup.
