# Adjust the Telegraf sampling interval

Only do this if strictly necessary! Reducing the number of samples will have an impact on the correctness of the data transmitted to the Eyer anomaly detection.

To adjust the Telegraf sampling frequency, please open the telegraf .conf file that was provided by Eyer in a text editor. The section to edit is at the top part of the config file, see example below.


```conf
# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "1s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true
```
Modify the `interval = "1s"` section to the value you want. We do not recommend setting this any lower than 10 seconds, as a lot of datapoints will be missing to calculate the 1 minute aggregation that Telegraf is using.

Save your config file and restart the Telegraf agent for your new settings to be applied.
