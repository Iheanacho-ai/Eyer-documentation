# Getting Started
Eyer is an AI-powered observability platform made for established solutions providers and tech ecosystems to easily integrate and enhance their value proposition

By automatically detecting and filtering out damaging anomalies, anomaly detection safeguards your data. Your data is the backbone of your business and exposing it to risks can threaten your performance. Without anomaly detection, you could forfeit the income and reputation that you have built over time.

```
npm run new eyer
